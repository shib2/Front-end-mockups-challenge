# Project Requirements:
## When submitting the form:
## a. If the email field does not validate, an error message should be rendered.
## b. If the email field is valid, the form should submit and log the value of each field in the browser console without refreshing the page.
## c. It will show a loading state for 2 seconds, to simulate an HTTP request. 
## d. It should allow only a single submission. That is, subsequent attempts to submit should be ignored after the initial submission. 
## e. After the simulated request, a "thank you" message should replace the form without refreshing the page.
